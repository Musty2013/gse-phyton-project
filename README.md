GSE301 Python Project
Student Academic Performance Analysis System
Course: GSE301 – Data Science: Python Fundamentals
Institution: University of Ilorin
Project Type: Individual
Student Name: AHMED MUSTAPHA 
Matric Number: 22/77JA029

Project Overview
This project implements a Student Academic Performance Analysis System using Python fundamentals. The system stores, processes, and analyzes student academic records and provides insights such as graduation eligibility and top-performing students.

The project demonstrates practical use of Python programming concepts taught in GSE301, organized into a real-world academic workflow.

Concepts Demonstrated
✔ Variables and data types
✔ Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
✔ Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
✔ match-case pattern matching
✔ Type casting and validation
✔ Exception handling (try/except)
✔ List slicing and indexing
✔ Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
✔ Logical operators (and, or)
✔ Interactive menu system
✔ Nested dictionary processing
